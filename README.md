# **CloudCradle**

*Effortless Oracle Cloud Always-Free Tier Deployment*

---

## 🌟 What is CloudCradle?

**CloudCradle** is an out-of-the-box solution for standing up a fully functional Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environment — **exclusively using resources from the "Always Free" tier**.

It provides both **Bash** and **Python** implementations to handle the complex setup steps that typically frustrate developers working with OCI.

## 💡 Why I Created This

Setting up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — even for basic usage — involves multiple complex steps:
- Installing and configuring OCI CLI
- Generating API keys and managing authentication
- Fetching region-specific information (availability domains, image OCIDs)
- Creating SSH keys for instance access
- Setting up Terraform variables with correct values

Spinning up an Oracle Cloud account — even just to use the ***Always Free*** tier — can be unnecessarily tedious. 
Between obscure documentation, CLI nuances, Terraform quirks, and OCI's unique design decisions, it's easy to get 
stuck. Eventually we all have to read the 100 pages of outdated documentation and figure it out ourselves through 
trial and error--until now. It's probably why OCI gives you a trial month to do pretty much anything for free, 
otherwise I'm certain I would have triggered billing accidentally and woke up to a mess.

**CloudCradle was born to save others the headache.**
I wanted a setup where:

* You don’t have to bounce between docs and dashboards.
* Everything is **repeatable** and **transparent**.
* You can **learn** from it, not just run it.

This tool automates all of these steps, providing a seamless experience whether you're a cloud beginner or an experienced developer.

### Switching OCI accounts / profiles

OCI CLI authentication is stored in `~/.oci/config` using named *profiles* (e.g. `DEFAULT`, `MYACCOUNT`, etc). CloudCradle will **reuse an existing working profile by default**.

If you want to log in as a different OCI account (or just create a separate profile), run:

```bash
# Forces browser login and prompts for a new profile name
FORCE_REAUTH=true ./setup_oci_terraform.sh
```

To use a specific existing profile without re-authenticating:

```bash
OCI_PROFILE=MYPROFILE ./setup_oci_terraform.sh
```

About the “choose a region” and “create a profile” prompts:
- `oci session authenticate` requires a `--region`. If your profile already has a region configured, CloudCradle will reuse it; otherwise, OCI CLI will prompt you to choose one.
- `oci session authenticate` is designed to *create/update a session profile*. CloudCradle passes the profile name automatically (so you should not be forced to re-type it), but OCI will still prompt if required values are missing.

To skip the region selection menu during browser auth:

```bash
OCI_AUTH_REGION=us-chicago-1 ./setup_oci_terraform.sh
```

Session tokens are time-bounded by OCI (commonly up to ~60 minutes). CloudCradle will attempt `oci session refresh` when it detects an expired session; you can also refresh manually:

```bash
oci session refresh --profile MYPROFILE
```

To “log out” / force a clean slate, you can back up and remove the OCI config and sessions:

```bash
mv ~/.oci/config ~/.oci/config.bak
rm -rf ~/.oci/sessions
```

### Helper scripts

A convenience script is provided to retry `terraform apply` when OCI reports temporary "Out of Capacity" errors. It performs exponential backoff and will stop on non-retryable errors.

Usage:

```bash
# Run retry helper with default settings (auto-approve):
make apply-retry

# Or run it directly
./scripts/out_of_capacity.sh --plan tfplan

# Run quick repository checks locally
make ci-check

# Run shellcheck locally (requires shellcheck installed)
make lint
```

The helper logs to `scripts/out_of_capacity.log` so you can inspect attempts and failure reasons.
